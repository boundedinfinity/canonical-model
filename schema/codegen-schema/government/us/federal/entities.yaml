      description: |
          A limited liability company (LLC) is a structure allowed by state statute. An LLC is formed by filing 
          articles of organization with the individual state's secretary of state. Owners of an LLC are called 
          members. Members may include individuals, corporations, other LLCs, and foreign entities. An LLC can be 
          formed by one or more members, and there is no maximum number of members. An LLC can also be organized as 
          a professional limited liability company (PLLC) or a limited company (LC). For federal tax purposes, an 
          LLC may be treated as a partnership or a corporation, or be disregarded as an entity separate from its 
          owner.

          A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is an entity organized under the laws of a state. You must file or
          intend to file articles of organization with your state before you can be recognized as an LLC. There can 
          only be one LLC with the same name in any one state.
