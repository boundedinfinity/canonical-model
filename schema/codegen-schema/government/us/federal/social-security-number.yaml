                The Social Security Number Group Number.

                Given the Social Security Number's format:

                    AAA-GG-SSS

                The group number is the middle 2 digits.

                Within each area, the group number (middle two (2) digits) 
                range from 01 to 99 but are not assigned in consecutive order. 
                For administrative reasons, group numbers issued first consist 
                of the ODD numbers from 01 through 09 and then EVEN numbers 
                from 10 through 98, within each area number allocated to a 
                State. After all numbers in group 98 of a particular area have 
                been issued, the EVEN Groups 02 through 08 are used, followed 
                by ODD Groups 11 through 99.

                Group numbers are assigned as follows:

                | Type | Numbers            |
                | ---- | ------------------ |
                | ODD  | 01, 03, 05, 07, 09 |
                | EVEN | 02, 04, 06, 08     |
